# Petit H√©risson Pipou

The goal of this collective project was to improve this social network by linking data and create dynamic pages. His name Petit H√©rison Pipou means Little Cute Hedgehog and was inspired by PHP's acronym.

We let you discover this social network! ü¶î

## Tech Stack

**Front:** HTML, CSS

**Back:** PHP, MySQL, Apache with MAMP

## How to install and use the project

To install the project, you can download [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/downloads/) which contains a local server thanks to Apache, PHP and MySQL for running the project.

During this, you can clone the repository in the htdocs inside MAMP's folder with ssh

```bash
  git clone git@github.com:laure-sterne/petitHerissonPipou.git
```
or https method

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/laure-sterne/petitHerissonPipou.git
```

When it is done, you can run MAMP which will start your local server accessible with [his homepage](http://localhost/MAMP/). You will find the repository's folder which will open our social network.

But the social network doesn't work because we don't import the database. So, in the MAMP's homepage, we have to go in [phpMyAdmin](http://localhost/phpMyAdmin/?lang=en) under Tools in navigation bar. 

When you are in phpMyAdmin, at the menu, you can import all files with extension .sql ‚Äì which is **Niveau1.sql** and **Niveau2.sql** ‚Äì thanks to excute button. After that, you can see in the left menu that a new table was created and named **socialnetwork**.

When its all done, you can go back to the homepage's MAMP and click to [My Website](http://localhost/) in the navigation bar what will lead you to your localhost with the links. You just have to choose one page that you want to see in the repository's folder, especially in Niveau1's folder. 

You have access to the social network, good job!

## Lessons Learned

What did you learn while building this project? What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?

It was really interesting to manipulate MAMP and learn PHP and mySQL languagues. The structure of this project was a new way to learn for us because we are not creating but we resume an existing code file to improve it. So, we have a first reading to understand and find yourself in the code. After that, we had to make improvements.

Besides, during the two weeks of this sprint, we have worked on remote the first week. This environment pushed us to communicate and collaborate more by doing pair programming in order to stay motivated. And this project also allowed me to learn more about myself but above all to communicate in a benevolent and non-violent way thanks to a method.
